path: /Users/alanmliang/Desktop/Parking-Database/model-training/datasets/vehicle_pose  # dataset root dir
train: images/train  # train images (relative to 'path')
val: images/val  # val images (relative to 'path')
test: images/test  # test images (optional)

# Classes
names:
  0: vehicle

# Keypoints
kpt_shape: [9, 3]  # number of keypoints, number of dims (x,y,visible)
flip_idx: []  # no keypoint flipping for vehicles as they are asymmetric

# Keypoint names and connections
keypoints:
  0: front_bumper_center  # Front bumper center
  1: rear_bumper_center   # Rear bumper center
  2: front_left_wheel     # Front left wheel
  3: front_right_wheel    # Front right wheel
  4: rear_left_wheel      # Rear left wheel
  5: rear_right_wheel     # Rear right wheel
  6: left_mirror          # Left mirror
  7: right_mirror         # Right mirror
  8: roof_center          # Roof center

# Skeleton - keypoint connections for visualization
skeleton:
  - [0, 1]  # Front to rear bumper
  - [2, 3]  # Front wheels
  - [4, 5]  # Rear wheels
  - [2, 4]  # Left side wheels
  - [3, 5]  # Right side wheels
  - [6, 7]  # Mirrors
  - [6, 8]  # Left mirror to roof
  - [7, 8]  # Right mirror to roof
  - [0, 8]  # Front bumper to roof
  - [1, 8]  # Rear bumper to roof
